# NoSql_LAB1

This Lab includes Map Reduce programs on Hadoop. 

## Question 2: Finding maximum temperature problem
            Input - Input.txt (Contains data of weather of years 1901 and 1902)
            Output - Output_maxTemp.txt (Gives the yearly maximum temperature record)
            Source code - maxTemperature.java   

## Question 3: Program for finding number of times .jpg, .gif and other image file that have been accessed by clients
            input - Input_web_access_log.txt (web access log produced by a web server)
            output - Output_ImgCounter_Q3.txt (Outputs the number of times GIF, JPG, and other image files that have been accessed by clients)
            Source code - imgCounter.java
            
## Question 4: Map reduce program for same data as Q3 but here the form of output is <year-month,number of requests,Download size>
            Input - Input_web_access_log.txt (web access log produced by a web server)
            Output - Output_DownloadDataSize_Q4.txt (Outputs Total number of requests and Total download size on Monthly basis)
            Source code - downloadData.java       

## Question 5: Map reduce program that lists timestamp, URL for which http response status has been 404 
            Input - Input_web_access_log.txt (web access log produced by a web server)
            Output - Output_Error404Counter_Q5.txt (Outputs the list of Timestamp, URL for which http response status has been 404)
            Source code - error404.java
